# Project setup

## Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your iOS/Android device
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Running the App

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Once the Expo development server starts:
- Scan the QR code with your iOS camera or Expo Go app to run on iOS
- Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on Android
- Press 'i' to open in iOS simulator
- Press 'a' to open in Android emulator

Note: For iOS users, you can scan the QR code directly with your camera app. For Android users, you'll need to scan it through the Expo Go app.
